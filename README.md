# Pseudo-3D-graphics
A program has been developed that simulates 3D graphics in a console environment using mathematical calculations of coordinates, distances, and object sizes. The program allows for the display of three-dimensional objects (such as walls) using varying text characters depending on their position in space. The program is written in C++ within the IDE Visual Studio.
